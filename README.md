![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/emrcloud/image/upload/v1594049564/upload/Concert_Junkie_Neon_m6akfi.png)

**A front-end capstone project from [Evan Reynolds](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanmaxreynolds/) for Nashville Software School C40.**

### **Concert Tracker**

**Description:** I created an app that allows users to track concerts that they've been to as well as total number of artists/bands seen, total number of venues/locations they've been too, and how many concerts they attended per year. Users can also upload photos and videos of the concerts.

**Purpose:** The reason I created this app is because I go to concerts as often as I can and sometimes I forget what artists/bands I've seen or where I've seen them. I wanted something to be able to track all that information and it's nice to look back and previous concerts to trigger forgotten memories.
